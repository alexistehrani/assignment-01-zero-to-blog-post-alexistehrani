            <p>The Cuban Missile Crisis has gone down in history as one of the closest instances the world has come to full blown nuclear warfare. In only 13 days, two of the world's greatest superpowers, the Soviet Union and the United States, had the world at a standstill through an intense military standoff. One one end, the Soviet Union had nuclear missiles stored in Cuba, just under 200km from American borders. On the other, the United States had secretly stashed their nuclear missiles in Turkey and Italy. It is estimated that if peace had not been achieved, that war could have resulted in the deaths of over 200 million people across the world. </p>

              <p>Now, one might wonder... how did these missiles end up in third party countries? Simply put, the United States had already placed precautionary nuclear missiles across Western Europe and Turkey. Knowing this, <i>Nikita Khrushchev</i>, the USSR premier at the time, believed it was necessary to even the playing field by increasing the Soviet nuclear striking range. At this point in time, Cuba had elected <i>Fidel Castro</i>, a leftist revolutionary who had alligned Cuba with the USSR during the <i>Cold War</i>. Cuban-Soviet relations included military and economic aid. </p>

              <p>After a U.S. U2 spy plane discovered the missiles in Cuba, an exclusive circle of advisors met in private between October 16 and 19th. These meetings became formalized on the 20th, and went on to be known as <i>ExComm</i>, the Executive Committee of the National Security Council. Chairman  of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Maxwell Taylor, advocated for taking out the Cubans with '<i>right out with one hard crack</i>,' through air strikes, followed up with an immediate invasion. Dean Rusk, the Secretary of State at the time believed that warning Castro of the consequences of USSR allightment would be enough. And Secretary of Defence McNamara believed that the best solution was <i>blockading</i> future weapon shipments to Cuba to avoid military action. </p>

              <img alt="President Kennedy with advisors after ExComm meeting on October 29, 1962" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/President_Kennedy_with_advisors_after_EXCOMM_meeting%2C_29_October_1962.jpg">

              <p>On October 22 1962, U.S. President John F. Kennedy delivered what is considered one, if not the most, important foreign policy speech of his presidency. He first announced the discoveration of the missiles, which for the Soviets was the first comfirmation that the U.S. was aware of their armament in Cuba. In addition to this, he also announced plans of a naval blockade, stating a '<i>strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba</i>' and that '<i>Chairman Khrushchev halt and eliminate this clandes- tine, reckless, and provocative threat to world peace</i>.' By October 25th, Khrushchev wrote a personal letter to President Kennedy, stating that if the U.S. promises to leave Cuba alone, '<i>the necessity for the presence of our military specialists in Cuba would disappear</i>.' </p>

              <p>Up until this point, the person letters between the two leaders were kept between government circles. on October 26th Krushchev wrote a new letter, deamed the 'Saturday Letter,' which was a <i>public</i> letter which included a new demand: the withdrawal of missiles in Turkey. Though Kennedy's advisors were against this, the President found it necessary to accept the additional request to '<i>look like a very fair trade</i>.' Though peace seemed close it was shortlived as Primier Khrushchev recieved a ltter from Castro, claiming that an American attack in the next 24 to 72 hours was '<i>almost inevitable</i>' through a massive air strike or invasion. Castro asked Khrushchev to consider the use of using Soviet weapons against the Americans, claiming '<i>However difficult and horrifying this decision may be . . . there is, I believe, no other recourse</i>.' </p>


              <p>As a result, that same day, Cuba striked its first attack against the United States. Air defences in Cuba shot at the closeby American reconnaissance, shooting down an American U-2 plane and killing the pilot, Major Rudolph Anderson. This, combined with the letter recieved put Khrushchev on edge, who wrote a letter back to Castro highlight the severityy of the situation. Khrushchev warned Castro that even a '<i>simple strike</i> would start war. </p>
